# Effective W interaction in Hubbard model

This repository contains scripts and code for data processing and generating plots related to the paper on the effective 
W interaction in the Hubbard model. These scripts assist in analyzing the data and visualizing the results presented in the paper: [Emergent nearest-neighbor attraction in the fully renormalized interactions of the single-band repulsive Hubbard model at weak coupling](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.108.165149).
